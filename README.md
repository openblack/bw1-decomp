## Source
The `src/` directory contains the decompilation source and the tools needed to rebuild the original `runblack.exe` executable.

See [src/README.md](src/README.md) for more details.

## Debug Symbols

This recompilation also produces a version with debug symbols which include Global's, function definition and struct definitions.

It's easy to use with tools like Ghidra and Ida Pro by going into Actions/ and downloading the debug artifact from reassemble.yaml.

For live debugging, it must be built locally using the RelWithDebInfo build type and launched with the current directory being the original game files directory (where runblack.exe lives).
